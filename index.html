      <h5 class="w3-center">Where I Began</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Hey, my name is Shant Manoukian and I am 17 years old and live in Los Angeles, California. My family is from Lebanon but we are Lebanese and I think it explains a big part of who I am. Currently, I am attending a private high school called Damien and I am planning to graduate this year to advance to hopefully a 4 year private college,but we can get into that later. </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-black w3-hide-medium">Almost everything that I know comes from my two amazing parents. I went to a public school for the first eight years then decided to change it up for the last four. I also have an older sister that is 25 years old and she is one of my biggest role models. People like her are what keep me motivated every day.   I just love meeting new people and sharing memories that will last forever.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">My Goals</h1><br>
	  <p class="w3-Large">My goals have always been contraversing themselves almost every day. i have definitely had too many different end goals and it has been hard figuring out what I want to do for the rest of my life. However, I think I have finally found my true passion, which is Dentistry. Obviously I have to take this adventure I'm about to embark step by step hoping I do not make too many mistakes. When I was a kid I did not have the "common" mindset. I never wanted to be a cop or a firefighter but I did want to make it somewhere special.  </p>
